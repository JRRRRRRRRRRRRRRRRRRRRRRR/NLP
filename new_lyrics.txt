being one of your offsprings\nOf the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that\nThere\u2019s nothing but turmoil goin\u2019 on so, I wanted to ask you\nWhat you think is the future for me and my generation today?\n\nI think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores\nAnd next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed\nFor real, I don\u2019t think America know that\nI think America think we was just playing\nAnd it\u2019s gonna be some more playing but\nIt ain\u2019t gonna be no playing\nIt\u2019s gonna be murder, you know what I\u2019m saying?\nIt\u2019s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s gonna happen\n\nThat\u2019s crazy man, in my opinion\nOnly hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations\nLot a people don\u2019t understand how important it is, you know\nSometimes I can like, get behind a mic\nAnd I don\u2019t know what type of energy I\u2019ma push out\nOr where it comes from, trip me out sometimes\n\nBecause it's spirits, we ain\u2019t even really rappin\u2019\nWe just letting our dead homies tell stories for us\nDamn\n\nI wanted to read one last thing to you\nIt\u2019s actually something a good friend had wrote\nDescribing my world, it says:\n\u201cThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts\nHe\u2019s trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\"\nWhat\u2019s your perspective on that?\nPac? Pac? Pac?!\n\n[Produced by Sounwave]\n\n"}

see niggas in this bitch\nStuntin', poppin' bottles\nGettin' drunk with these bitches\nAnd when they leave they get followed\nFall asleep with that bitch\nAnd really don't know much about her\nThen she let us in, we take all of your shit\nAnd when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]\nI be with bitches that be with bitches\nThat be with niggas with riches\nI tell her, \"Get him,\" she say, \"I got you\"\nI say, \"No, bitch, I said get him\"\nAnd they so pretty, and they hair lengthy\nHe hit it and sleep on her titties\nThen she give us the word, we come through with AKs\nIt's a stick-up, she scream like a victim\nNow you feelin' so silly\nI smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)\nNappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?\nWatch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)\nYou can get snaked, you can get faked\nOut by the bitch that you feelin'\n'Cause you thought that she was an angel\nThat bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee\nAnd you tellin' your business, she tell me your business\nYou tell that bitch what you feelin'\nAll of the beans you be spillin'\nTo you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's\nShe know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden\nShe know when you're gone, tell me when to visit\nWe break in your home and take the specifics\nAnd meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him\nSo she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains\nWe find out addresses, and we don't leave messes\nYou'll only know that it's gone when you check it\nThen your first thought is to start second guessin'\nShe say, \"What's wrong?\" He say, \"Nothin', keep restin'\"\nShe say, \"What's missin'?\", \"How you know somethin' missin'?\"\nHe scratch his head, she say, \"Get back in bed\"\nAnd she gave him some head\nBoy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say\u2014ooh\n\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nI see niggas in this bitch\nStuntin', poppin' bottles\nGettin' drunk with these bitches\nThen when they leave they get followed\nI be with bitches that know the bitches\nThat's with the niggas we followin'\nGet them on the line, stay two cars behind\nAnd tell them hoes, \"Don't be so obvious!\"\nMona Lisa, long hair, don't care\nShe handle the business and don't ever tell\nShe bite the bullet and cough up the shells\nShe tell 'em, \"Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!\"\nAnd if he say yeah, then we meet him there\nShe feed him lies with his silverware\nShe don't want love, she just want her share\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nI know a bitch named Liz\nThis nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is\nSo he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears\nAnd then she tell me and I be all ears\nAnd then I go and tell my people and they already know him\nAnd then I call Liz and she say he comin' over\nI say, \"Good girl, just remember what I told ya\"\nShe gave me the salute, I say, \"Girl, you're a soldier\"\nWe're waitin' outside, watch him pull up\nWalk up to the door and right before he knock\nShe open the door naked, she left it unlocked\nThey started French kissin' so he didn't see moi\nAnd then she let him in, they stopped on the couch\nMusic up loud with his head in the clouds\nTurn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him\nPiss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown\nNigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around\nI ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down\nYou know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up\nLiz, that's enough, you can put your hands down\nAnd then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her\nShe a good actress and you a dead actor\nYou'll be dead after we get what we're after\nIf Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh\nI got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga\nBut think for me, nigga\nSend her to you like she ain't for me, nigga\nI hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga\nShe pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga\nShe slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga\nMona Lisa, I done painted the picture\nMo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas\nPussy got you out of character, nigga\nYou fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga\nTake everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion\nWe have your attention\nAnd now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga\nNow she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga\nWe just lookin' for the casserole, nigga\nBut she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (uh)\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nAh, every day she wake up with a different color makeup\nAnd a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall\nChillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter\nFour minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball\nPaparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh\nProbably on a Internet blog\nIn a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother\nMan, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow\nMona Lisa\nPussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls\nAnd he diggin' in it like he livin' in it\nMake a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God\nPoetry in a pear tree\nSweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him\nDid he want to make love in a yellow taxi\nNever gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat\nWoke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby\nThen he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie\nI'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing\nI'ma call up again like I did last week\nMake good with the friend and I'm all jazzy\nBritney with the twin and the girl Ashley\nFound out that I fucked, he was unhappy\nBitch, I never let the bullshit get past me\nBetter yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me\n'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting\nFucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone\nBut you sucked this dick, that's just nasty\nMatter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)\nYou fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)\nBitch, gimme your phone! (No!)\nLet me, let me take this call real quick\n(\u2026 lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?\nIs that the shit that you do? [sniffing]\nTouchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos\nJump on the internet, watchin' his interviews\nI don't know what the fuck lately got into you\nTell me who love you, I bet I love harder\nForgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?\nThe Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma\nDaycare after school and she never did charge ya\nYou scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up\nYou know what, I give up, let me go get my gun\nI got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'\nGoddammit, you know that the damage is done\nBitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress\nI'm not supposed to go through this, I guess\nSo in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy\nI'm killin' myself\n\n[Refrain: Lil Wayne]\nShe say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nOoh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nShe say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nNow he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah\n\n"}

concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n[Verse 1]\nI woke up this morning and figured I'd call you\nIn case I'm not here tomorrow\nI'm hopin' that I can borrow\nA peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important\nMy mind is really distorted\nI find nothing but trouble in my life\nI'm fortunate you believe in a dream\nThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine\nAnd last night was just another distraction\nOr a reaction of what we consider madness\nI know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands\nMy plan's rather vindictive\nEverybody's a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride it's a murderous rhythm\nAnd outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back, whispering \"Get 'em!\"\nI got 'em and I ain't give a fuck\nThat same mentality I told my brother not to duck\nIn actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors\nI wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover\nThe life that I knew as a youngin\nIn pajamas and dun-ta-duns\nWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb\nNiggas like me never prosper\nPrognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted\nThis Piru shit been in me forever\nSo forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever\nAnd I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did\nJust promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big\nAnd if I die before your album drop, I hope\u2014 [Gunshots]\n\n[Chorus]\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou wrote a song about my sister on your tape\nAnd called it Section.80\nThe message resembled \"Brenda's Got a Baby\"\nWhat's crazy was I was hearin' about it\nBut doubted your ignorance\nHow could you ever just put her on blast and shit?\nJudgin' her past and shit?\nWell, it's completely my future\nHer nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit\nAnd I'ma need that forty dollars\nEven if I got to fuck, suck and swallow\nIn the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed\nBy a married man, and father of three\nMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys\nMatter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's\nHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last week\nThis is the life of another girl damaged by the system\nThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em\nSee, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em\nBack to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim\nOf a family gene that show women how to be woman\nOr better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'\nThen you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught\nThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossed\nAnd I'm exhausted, but fuck that \"Sorry for your loss\" shit\nMy sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain\nIf you can't fit the pumps I walk in?\nI'll wait\u2026 Your rebuttal a little too late\nAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song\n'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own\nAnd matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?\nA doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight\nI'll probably live longer than you and never fade away\nI'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate\nAnd I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'\nI'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'\nYou lyin' to these motherfuckers\nTalkin' about you can help 'em with my story\nYou can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga\nDon't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n[Verse 3]\nSometimes I look in the mirror\nAnd ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?\nIf it's today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'\nThe scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed\nMay the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot\nAnd every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots\nAnd I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threats\nThat can come about, \u2019cause the tongue is mighty powerful\nAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch\nMaybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death\nReally stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest\nAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister's situation was the one that pulled me\nIn a direction to speak on somethin'\nThat's realer than the TV screen\nBy any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like \"It need to be told\"\nCursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul\nExactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'\nOr steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's\nI count lives, all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong\nFightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong\nAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone\nAm I worth it? Did I put enough work in?\n\n[Chorus]\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n[Outro]\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\n\n[Part II: \"I'm Dying of Thirst\"]\n\n[Produced by Skhye Hutch]\n\n[Skit]\n(On the phone)\n\"Ay, ay, ay, Where you 'bout to go?\"\n\"Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!\"\n\"Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga.

II]\n\n[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]\nYeah, yeah\nYoung Egypt\nLook, look\n\n[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]\nI feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged\nOur Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large\nCame in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds\nWhat an accomplishment, broken promises\nKept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence\nThe greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is\nYou niggas fear me like y'all fear God\nYou sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice\nJust know the mechanics of making your choice and writin' your bars\nBefore you poke out your chest, loosen your bra\nBefore you step out of line and dance with the star\nI could never end a career if it never start\nThe murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies\nWith batteries to the head\nThe flattery of watchin' my stock rise\nThe salary, the compensation tripled my cock size\nI run through these stop signs with no brake fluid\nJust premium gas, do it for dolo\nCrash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo\nBlack excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin\nHope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better\nI blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather\nForecastin' my future, this is the future\nThe mastermind until my next album, more power to you\n*Gunshot*\n\n[Part III]\n\n[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Taz Arnold]\nCome on,
